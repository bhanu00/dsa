The log(n) function, commonly known as the logarithm function, is used to represent the number of times a value needs to be divided by a specific base to reach 1. The formula for calculating log(n) depends on the base of the logarithm.

The most common bases used for logarithms are:

    Binary logarithm (base 2): The binary logarithm, denoted as log₂(n), represents the number of times a value needs to be divided by 2 to reach 1. It is calculated using the formula:

    log₂(n) = log(n) / log(2)

    Natural logarithm (base e): The natural logarithm, denoted as ln(n) or log(n) without a base specified, represents the number of times a value needs to be divided by the mathematical constant e (approximately 2.71828) to reach 1. It is calculated using the formula:

    ln(n) = log(n) / log(e)

    Common logarithm (base 10): The common logarithm, denoted as log₁₀(n), represents the number of times a value needs to be divided by 10 to reach 1. It is calculated using the formula:

    log₁₀(n) = log(n) / log(10)

In most cases, when discussing the time complexity of algorithms or data structures, we refer to the binary logarithm (base 2), denoted as log₂(n) or simply log(n).

The formula for calculating the binary logarithm (log₂(n)) of a number n is:

log₂(n) = y

where 2^y = n

In other words, log₂(n) is the power to which 2 must be raised to obtain n.

For example:

    log₂(8) = 3, because 2^3 = 8
    log₂(16) = 4, because 2^4 = 16
    log₂(32) = 5, because 2^5 = 32

In programming languages, the logarithm function is typically provided as a built-in function, such as Math.log() in Java, math.log() in Python, or log() in C++. These functions usually calculate the natural logarithm (base e) by default, but most languages also provide a way to calculate logarithms with different bases, such as Math.log2() for base 2 or Math.log10() for base 10.
